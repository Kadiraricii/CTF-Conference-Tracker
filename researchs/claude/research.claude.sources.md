I've created a comprehensive source list documenting all 70+ sources used in this deep research. The sources are organized into categories:

**Primary Data Sources (21)**: CTFtime API, Black Hat, DEF CON, BSides, RSA, OWASP, CCC, and archive sources like GitHub and YouTube

**Technical Standards (5)**: RFC 5545 (iCalendar), Google Calendar API, YouTube Data API, GitHub API, and related specifications

**Security Resources (4)**: OWASP Top 10, API Security guidelines, robots.txt RFC, and web scraping best practices

**Framework Documentation (10+)**: FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Celery, Playwright, BeautifulSoup4, Redis, and more

**Infrastructure & Services (8)**: Docker, Vercel, AWS, Railway, and deployment platforms

**Monitoring & Security Tools (11)**: Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana, WAF solutions, secrets management

**Additional Libraries & Tools (20+)**: Python libraries, frontend frameworks, search engines, and community resources

The research involved:
- **1 direct API fetch** (CTFtime documentation)
- **9 targeted web searches** covering APIs, scraping ethics, calendar integration, and security
- **Cross-referencing** multiple authoritative sources for technical accuracy

Each source includes the URL, type (API/HTML/Documentation), content description, and key technical details like rate limits, authentication requirements, and legal/ToS notes.
