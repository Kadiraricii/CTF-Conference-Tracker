# 🗺️ CyberTracker Strategic Roadmap

> **Vision:** To become the central nervous system for Global SecOps, unifying CTF competitions, security conferences, and threat intelligence into a single, autonomous platform.

---

## 📅 2026 Timeline & Milestones

### **Phase 1: The Foundation (Current Status: v1.0)**
*Focus: Stability, Core Data Ingestion, and Basic Visualization.*

*   **✅ Core Architecture**
    *   FastAPI Async Backend with modular design.
    *   Docker & Docker-Compose orchestration.
    *   PostgreSQL + Alembic for robust data management.
*   **✅ Data Ingestion**
    *   CTFtime API & RSS integration.
    *   Automated scheduler for daily updates.
*   **✅ User Interface**
    *   "Cyber" aesthetics with Glassmorphism.
    *   Responsiveness for Desktop & Tablet.

---

### **Phase 2: Intelligence & Personalization (Q1 2026)**
*Focus: AI-driven insights and user-specific features.*

#### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Layer
*   **Smart Summarization:** Integrate deep-learning models (Llama 3 / GPT-4o) to generate 1-sentence summaries of complex event descriptions.
*   **Difficulty Prediction:** Analyze keywords to predict if a CTF is "Beginner-Friendly" or "Hardcore" before the user joins.
*   **Trend Analysis:** Detect rising topics (e.g., "Quantum Cryptography", "eBPF Exploitation") across conferences.

#### 👤 User Ecosystem
*   **Authentication System:**
    *   JWT-based secure login.
    *   OAuth2 integration (GitHub/Google Login).
*   **Personalized Feeds:**
    *   "Watchlist" for specific teams or event series.
    *   Custom calendar exports based on filters (e.g., "Only European Conferences").

---

### **Phase 3: Community & Collaboration (Q2 2026)**
*Focus: Social features and team coordination.*

*   **🛡️ Team Management:**
    *   Create "Squads" to track which team members are attending which CTF.
    *   Internal chat/notes widget for each event card.
*   **📢 Social Integrations:**
    *   **Discord Bot:** Two-way integration (Slash commands to query upcoming events).
    *   **Twitter/X Auto-Poster:** Automatically tweet about high-profile CTFs starting in <1 hour.
*   **🌍 Interactive Globe:**
    *   WebGL-based 3D Earth view showing conference locations in real-time.

---

### **Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026)**
*Focus: Mobile, Public API, and Enterprise features.*

*   **📱 Mobile Application (PWA -> Native):**
    *   Push notifications for "CTF Starting Now".
    *   Offline mode for conference schedules.
*   **🔌 Public Intelligence API:**
    *   Monetizable API endpoints for other security platforms to consume our normalized dataset.
*   **🏢 Enterprise Dashboards:**
    *   Analytics on team participation and skill growth.
    *   Exportable PDF reports for management.

## 🛠️ Technical Debt & Engineering Goals

| Priority | Task | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔴 **High** | **Test Coverage > 90%** | Ensure stability before Phase 2 rollout. |
| 🟡 **Med** | **Migration to Asyncpg** | Maximize database concurrency under load. |
| 🟢 **Low** | **Service Mesh** | Prepare for microservices split (if needed). |

> [!NOTE]
> This roadmap is a living document. Priorities may shift based on community feedback and the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape.

> [!WARNING]
> **Phase 3 features** (Social Integrations) require strict privacy audits to prevent leaking sensitive team data.
